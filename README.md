# Prework - *CP_IOS_101_Prework*

Submitted by: **Gianelli Lagos**

**CP_IOS_101_Prework** is an app that involves me learning how to create a new project, add UI elements, connect UI elements to logic, and run my app.
I have added labels, buttons, and a fun gif. I have alos add a feature where on the click of a button the background color changes and one of the labels text changes.
Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [Done] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [Done] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
## Video Walkthrough

Here is a link to the demo:

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
App: Youtube
Adjusting video speed,
Miniplayer
App: Pinterest
Collages,
Boards
App: Slack
Huddles,
Catch-Up

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. 
Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. 
You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
 I would like to create an app that track the books you read and your progress, it would then recommend similar books.
 
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
While building the app figuring out where the certain buttons and features where on Xcode was the most time consuming part since I have not used Xcode before.
